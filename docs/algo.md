## What to Track in Your Sleep Log

_You should record each morning (as soon as you wake up) :_
* **Bedtime** (bedtime): when you got into bed
* **Wake-up time** (wakeup): when you got out of bed.
* **Sleep onset latency** (onset): how many minutes it took to fall asleep.
* **Duration of awakenings** (awake): time spent awake after initially falling asleep.
* **Total time in bed** (TIB)
* **Total sleep time** (TST)
* **Sleep efficiency** (SE) = TST ÷ TIB × 100

## Planning your new sleep schedule

_Patients are instructed to keep a baseline sleep log for 1–2 weeks before a sleep plan is established. The therapist uses the average sleep from the past week to create the first “New Sleep Plan._

**[The goal is for the patient to spend about the same time in bed as their average night’s sleep (average TST; +30 minutes is acceptable). However, the minimum time in bed is 5.5 hours. This may take some negotiation. Start with earliest typical wake time (e.g., “When is the earliest you need to wake up for work/school?”) and then count backwards to determine scheduled bedtime. If bedtime seems too late to the patient, you can move the entire schedule earlier.]** 

##  Adjusting Sleep Schedule

**[If the patient has been following their new sleep plan closely, they should be falling asleep faster at night and returning to sleep faster when they wake up. If so, we want to try to start increasing the amount of time we allow them in bed to try to move towards the amount of sleep they need to feel rested. If things are not going well, we will reduce or hold constant the amount of time in bed in the sleep plan. Follow the guidelines below using data from their sleep log from the previous week. Remember, exclude nights that were unusual and out of the patient’s control like charge of quarters, emergencies, illnesses.]**

**[Make the following adjustments based on average sleep efficiency (SE)]**

**SE is > 90%: [Increase time in bed by 15 minutes.]**
* It looks like you did well. For the next week you get to spend an extra 15 minutes in bed. Would you like to add that to your bedtime or wake time? **[earlier bedtime is preferable]**

**SE is between 85% and 90%: [No change to prescribed bedtime.]**
* It looks like you are on track. Let’s stay with this schedule for another week.

**SE is between 70% and 85%: [Decrease time in bed by 15 minutes.]**
* It looks like you still are not sleeping very well.
    * **[Review sleep log and make sure they were following the “New Sleep Plan” schedule from last session.]**
        * **[If major issues were seen then Troubleshoot as above]**
        * **[If no major issues were seen]** Since you are spending so much time awake in bed, let’s reduce your time in bed by another 15 minutes. Would you like to take this from your bedtime or wake time? **[later bedtime is preferable]**

**SE is < 70%: [Calculate new total sleep time and revise bedtime and/or wake time.]**
* **[If major issues with stimulus control and sleep restriction instructions were reported, then review and Troubleshoot as above]**
* **[If no major issues (unlikely)]** It looks like maybe we got it wrong last week. Let’s re-adjust your sleep schedule to more closely match your total sleep time.
